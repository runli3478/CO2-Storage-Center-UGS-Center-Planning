# CO2-Storage-Center-UGS-Center-Planning
Advisor for national level CO2 storage center/UGS center planning

**National-Level CO2 Storage Planning Advisory System**
> The National-Level CO2 Storage Planning Advisory System is designed to address the significant challenge of reducing global CO2 emissions. By optimizing energy resource structures, enhancing utilization efficiency, and implementing efficient CO2 storage solutions, this advisory system aims to assist in meeting emission reduction targets.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this advisory system is to provide high-level planning for CO2 storage at the national level. The system considers three key aspects: CO2 suppliers (capture sources), transportation networks, and storage locations. By following a systematic workflow, it helps identify suitable areas for CO2 storage centers, evaluates potential storage candidates and transportation networks, and ultimately provides recommendations to guide decision-making.

# Workflow
The advisory system follows a structured workflow, consisting of the following steps:

1. [x] Initial Step:
- Analyze national-level CO2 emission data from sources such as power plants and refineries to identify suitable areas for CO2 storage centers.
Utilize clustering techniques like Simple KNN to group potential storage locations across the country.

2. [ ] Evaluation of CO2 Storage Candidates and Transportation Networks:
  - Focus on the areas identified in step 1 to assess potential CO2 storage candidates, which may include depleted reservoirs, EOR reservoirs, or aquifers.
  - Consider several factors during the evaluation process:
    - Storage capacity must meet the requirements of the respective areas.
    - Prioritize storage safety by addressing geomechanics issues like casing and fault failures.
    - Conduct an economic evaluation, considering factors such as reusing existing networks and wells or determining low-cost options for new construction.

3. [ ] Advisory System Output:
- Suggest optimal locations for CO2 storage centers across the nation based on the analysis conducted in steps 1 and 2.
- Recommend suitable CO2 storage candidates for each center, considering capacity, safety, and economic viability.
- Propose a transportation network plan for efficient CO2 transport between capture sources and storage locations.

# Usage
To utilize the National-Level CO2 Storage Planning Advisory System:
- Input national-level CO2 emission data, focusing on power plants, refineries, and related sources.
- Run the system to identify suitable areas for CO2 storage centers using clustering techniques.
- Evaluate CO2 storage candidates and transportation networks based on the areas identified in step 1.
- Review the advisory system output, including optimal CO2 storage center locations, recommended storage candidates, and transportation network planning.
- Adaptation for Underground Gas Storage (UGS) Planning
- The same workflow can be adapted for Underground Gas Storage (UGS) center planning, considering natural gas consumption data instead of CO2 emissions in step 1.

**Note:**
> This advisory system serves as a valuable tool for countries aiming to reduce CO2 emissions effectively, optimize energy resource utilization, and implement sustainable CO2 storage solutions on a national scale.

_Disclaimer: The advisory system is a tool for decision support and should not be considered a substitute for expert analysis or professional judgment in implementing CO2 storage solutions._
